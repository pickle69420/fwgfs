<p>This website was, indeed, made by me and only me, as well as the method to unblock games. But the actual games or the content in them were not made nor modified by me. You are playing the raw games, with no modifications. These games were used on my website by means of frames, and I will not take credit for any glitches in the games not caused by the website itself. However, you may report to me if you want to report a bug, and I will try my best to contact the owners of the games. Thank you.</p>
